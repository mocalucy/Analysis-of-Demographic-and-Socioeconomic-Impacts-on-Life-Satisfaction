# **USA Demographics Data Analysis Project**

## **Overview**

This project is part of a course assignment focused on analyzing USA demographic data. The main objective was to clean the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights that could inform future data-driven decisions.

## **Project Structure**

### 1. **Data Cleaning** (`Data_Cleaning.Rmd`)
   - **Objective:** To clean and preprocess the raw USA demographic dataset.
   - **Key Steps:**
     - Addressed missing data through imputation techniques.
     - Corrected data types to ensure consistency across the dataset.
     - Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant features to streamline the data.
     - Created new features that added value to the dataset, enhancing the subsequent analysis.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** (`USA_EDA.Rmd`)
   - **Objective:** To explore the cleaned dataset and uncover key patterns and trends within the USA demographic data.
   - **Key Analyses:**
     - **Descriptive Statistics:** Provided a summary of key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
     - **Visualization:** Used tools like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to visualize the data's distribution and relationships.
     - **Outlier Detection:** Identified and addressed outliers that could have skewed the results.
     - **Trend Analysis:** Investigated demographic trends over time and across different regions.

## **Results**

- **Data Cleaning:** Successfully cleaned and prepared the dataset, making it suitable for detailed analysis.
- **EDA:** The analysis revealed significant trends in the demographic data, including [insert specific findings, e.g., population growth patterns, income distribution, etc.]. These insights provide a solid foundation for further research and data modeling.
